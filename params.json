{"name":"Yield","tagline":"A command-line utility for previewing markdown files in GitHub Flavored Markdown.","body":"# Yield\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/yield.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/yield)\r\n\r\nYield is a command line utility that generates a preview of README.md and markdown files using GitHub Flavored Markdown in your browser. It parses your markdown files using [GitHub's Markdown API](http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/), so you can preview it exactly how it will look on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [Ruby v1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or greater\r\n* [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com)\r\n* [launchy](https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy)\r\n\r\nInstall the gem by issuing the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gem install yield\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will also install any necessary dependencies for the gem that are not currently installed.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFrom the root of your project, or any folder containing a README.md file, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yield\r\n=* Yield is serving your markdown at http://localhost:4000/\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also specify a path to a markdown file you'd like to render, such as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Render a specific file\r\n$ yield UPDATES.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to view the preview of the file. You can stop the server by pressing Control+C.\r\n\r\nYield also supports relative URLs in the same directory, so you can preview other files by navigating to them in the URL bar. For example, you can preview the CHANGELOG.md file by navigating to [localhost:4000/CHANGELOG.md](http://localhost:4000/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nFinally, you can specify the port for the server to run on using the `-p` or `--port` option:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run the server on port 8080\r\n$ yield -p 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Potential Errors\r\n\r\n### OpenSSL Error\r\n\r\nYou may receive the following OpenSSL error after navigating to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) on Mac OS X 10.8.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenSSL::SSL::SSLError at /\r\nSSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server key exchange B: bad ecpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error seems to be cause by a hosed installation of OpenSSL on the system. You can resolve this error by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install openssl\r\n$ brew link openssl --force\r\n$ rvm reinstall 2.0.0 --with-gcc=gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this does not work for you, see the following links, which address the same issue:\r\n\r\n* [How to install Ruby 2.0.0 with RVM on OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion](http://scottyv.me/2013/03/How-to-install-ruby-2-0-0-on-OSX-Mountain-Lion/)\r\n* [“bad ecpoint” SSL error on fresh RVM Ruby 1.9.3 install on OSX Mountain Lion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15672133/bad-ecpoint-ssl-error-on-fresh-rvm-ruby-1-9-3-install-on-osx-mountain-lion)\r\n\r\n### Windows OpenSSL Error\r\n\r\nIf you receive an OpenSSL \"certificate verify failed\" error on Windows after launching the gem, the following steps will fix the issue.\r\n\r\n1. Download [http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem) and save it to C:\\cacert.pem.\r\n2. Go to Computer -> Advanced Settings -> Environment Variables and create a new System Variable:<br />\r\n  **Variable**: SSL_CERT_FILE<br />\r\n  **Value**: C:\\cacert.pem.\r\n4. Restart all command prompt windows and reissue the `yield` command.  \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
